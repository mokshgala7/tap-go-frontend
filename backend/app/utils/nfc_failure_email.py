"""
Email sent to a card's owner when an NFC tap did not complete.

Kept in its own module on purpose: it reuses the shared theme and delivery (send_email, which
records every attempt in email_logs) from email_service without changing that file. It mirrors
send_ride_passenger_email(status="Failed") and adds the reason, which that function cannot show.
No PDF is attached to a failure.
